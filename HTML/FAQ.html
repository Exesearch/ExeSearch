	<u class=FAQ_Heading><br><br>I'm lost! Please help.<br><br></u>
	If you are lost, load up Google maps. If you need immediate help,
	phone the campus Estate Patrol on 01392 723999, or if it's extremely

	<u class=FAQ_Heading><br><br>What is ExeSearch?<br><br></u>
	ExeSearch is a treasure hunt game designed to help new students
	find their way around campus and meet new people. Students are given
	clues to follow and tasks to complete in order to find their way to the
	final treasure.
	<u class=FAQ_Heading><br><br>How do I play the game?<br><br></u>
	Head to the quiz page. This is where you will be set all the challenges
	you'll need to complete to reach the end of the treasure hunt. You will
	be asked a question, and once you have the correct answer, type it in
	box and click "submit". After that, you will be given a clue leading
	you to a location on campus. You will need to walk to that location,
	then click the button to check your position. If you are in the right
	location, you will be given a task to do. This repeats until you have
	completed the treasure hunt.
